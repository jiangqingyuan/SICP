# 2.2 层次数据和闭包属性

box-and-pointer notation,, each object is shown as a pointer to a box. 

pairs provide a universal building block from which we can construct all sorts of data structures. 

The ability to create pairs whose elements are pairs we refer to as the closure property of cons.

 is the essence of list structure's importance as a representational tool

we've made essential use of closure in dealing with procedures, because all but the very simplest programs rely on the fact that the elements of a combination can themselves be combinations. In this section, we take up the consequences of closure for compound data. 

The use of the word ''closure'' here comes from abstract algebra, 

where a set of elements is said to be closed under an operation 

if applying the operation to elements in the set produces an element that is again an element of the set. 

The Lisp community also (unfortunately) uses the word ''closure'' to describe a totally unrelated concept: 

A closure is an implementation technique for representing procedures with free variables. We do not use the word ''closure'' in this second sense in this book.

组合方式应该满足闭包的概念是一个直截了当的想法。不幸的是，许多流行的编程语言中提供的数据组合器不满足闭包，或者使闭包难以利用。在 Fortran 或 Basic 中，通常通过将数据元素组装成数组来组合数据元素——但不能形成其元素本身就是数组的数组。 Pascal 和 C 承认其元素是结构的结构。然而，这要求程序员明确地操作指针，并遵守结构的每个字段只能包含预先指定形式的元素的限制。与 Lisp 及其pair不同，这些语言没有内置的，可以轻松地以统一的方式操作复合数据的，通用胶水。这种局限性存在于 Alan Perlis 在他的本书前言中的评论背后：``在 Pascal 中，过多的可声明数据结构导致函数内部的专门化，从而抑制和惩罚随意的合作。让 100 个函数在1个数据结构上运行比让10个函数在10个数据结构上运行要好。”

在本书中，我们使用list来表示由列表结束标记终止的a chain of pairs。相反，术语list structure指的是任何由pairs组成的数据结构，而不仅仅是list。

sequence -- an ordered collection of data objects.

Such a sequence of pairs, formed by nested conses, is called a list

值nil用于终止对链，可以被认为是一个没有元素的序列，即空列表。nil这个词是拉丁语nihil的缩略词，意思是 "没有"
 The difference between the two definitions is not that the computer is performing a different process (it isn't) but that we think about the process differently.

The representation of sequences in terms of lists generalizes naturally to represent sequences whose elements may themselves be sequences.

Another way to think of sequences whose elements are sequences is as trees.

Recursion is a natural tool for dealing with tree structures

In this section, we introduce another powerful design principle for working with data structures -- the use of conventional interfaces.
